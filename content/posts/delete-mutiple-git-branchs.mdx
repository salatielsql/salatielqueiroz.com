Sometimes you forgot to delete you local branchs, which happens to me all the time, and someday
you type `git branch` to see you local branchs and you ended up with a huge list.
So the best way would be deleting multiple branchs at the same time to save up some
time writing each branch name one by one.

**TLDR;**

You can delete multiple branchs by typing each name separated by spaces:

```bash
git branch -D branch1 branch2 branch2
```

Or if the branchs you want to delete has a shared name pattern you can use the code bellow to delete multiple branchs at the same time:

```bash
git branch -D `git branch --list 'prefix*'`
```

### Example

Deleting multiple branch with the same prefix:

```bash
# List your branchs
git branch

# Local branchs
main*
prefix-branch1
prefix-branch2
prefix-branch3

# delete all branchs with the 'prefix-' in their names
git branch -D `git branch --list 'prefix-*'`

# Check the list again
git branch

# Branchs deleted
main*
```

This works with any kind of pre or posfix too.
